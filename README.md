This site was created with the help of a channel. First of all, I have to thank the YouTube channel code with sadie for useful training.

I will post the code of this project and I will be happy if you use it in your projects :):)

for use the source first make a new folder second copy index.html and style-guide in that folder third make a new folder with css name and

copy style.css forth make a folder with js name and copy  script.js  and another folder with name images for pictures (i uploeded them here)

now you need asset folder and copy-paste all this folder over there (css-js-images) now you have your own site 


Let's see in the photo ...
